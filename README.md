## 📌 Overview

When a student reaches the hostel gate for an outing, the **security guard asks for the enrollment number** and updates the system through the website. This marks the student as “Out”. Upon the student's return, the guard updates the system again to mark the outing as “Closed”.

This ensures that every outing is recorded in real time and visible to both the warden and guardians.
